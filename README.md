# webContactForm
Simple Web Contact Form using PHP/jQuery/Bootstrap
A very basic contact form with Summernote for the message box and some basic validation provided by jQuery. A known bug prevents jQuery from validating WSYWIG text editors like Summernote. There are several 'hack' workarounds, but I did not include these into this project. The display page includes an option to edit or clear the form. I may add database functionality at a later time.
